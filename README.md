A Clojure library for building HTTP API gateways using Pedestal and core.async.

## Usage

Add the library as a dependency in your project.clj:

```clojure
[democracyworks/bifrost "0.3.0"]
```

Require the core namespace in your pedestal service namespace:

```clojure
(ns my-gateway.service
  (:require [bifrost.core :as bifrost]
            [clojure.core.async :as async))
```

Then you can use the `bifrost/interceptor` function to create
core.async-backed interceptors. You can pass either function that
returns a core.async channel, or a channel that you are handling
otherwise.

For example:

```clojure
(defn lookup-from-api [bifrost-request]
  (let [return-channel (async/promise-chan)]
    (async/thread
      (async/put! return-channel {:status :ok :lookup (long-running-request)))
    return-channel))

(def lookup-interceptor (bifrost/interceptor lookup-from-api))
```

Or:

```clojure
(def fibonacci-service (async/chan))

(async/go
  (loop [[return-channel bifrost-request] (async/<! fibonacci-service)]
    (->> bifrost-request
         :number
         calculate-fib
         (assoc {:status :ok} :fib)
         (async/put! return-channel))))

(def fibonnaci-interceptor (bifrost/interceptor fibonacci-service))
```

Bifrost interceptors have `enter` and `leave` functions.

When created with a channel-returning function, `enter` will call that
function with the bifrost request.

When created with a async channel, `enter` will put a message on that
channel. The message is a two-element vector. The first element is a
channel to put a response onto, and the second element is the
context's request transformed into a bifrost request.

Either way, the enter function returns the context with the response
channel as a key on `:response-channels`.

The `leave` function attempts to take from the response channel. If
it's already closed (e.g., if you've provided another interceptor in
the chain that deals with its contents) it will forward on the context
without change. If it can take from the response channel, it will
transform the response into a context with a response and merge it
with the incoming context. If it cannot take from the response channel
within the timeout, it will create a 504 response.

For interceptors that should have exclusive access to the response channel, use
`handler` instead, which assocs a 500 response when the response channel closes
unexpectedly.

Bifrost requests are Pedestal requests with the following changes:

* On GET and DELETE
  * Merges `:bifrost-params` -> `:path-params` -> `:query-params` (so
    `:bifrost-params` clobbers `:path-params` which clobbers
    `:query-params`) and puts the resulting map into a vector like:
    `[response-channel params-map]`. (The `response-channel` is
    created for you.)
* On POST, PUT, and PATCH
  * Merges `:bifrost-params` -> `:path-params` -> `:body-params` ->
    `:json-params` -> `:transit-params` -> `:edn-params` ->
    `:form-params` -> `:query-params` and puts the resulting map into
    a vector like: `[response-channel params-map]`. (The
    `response-channel` is created for you.)

Responses should be EDN maps that look like the following:

```clojure
{:status :ok} ; plus any other keys and values you'd like to add

;; or for errors
{:status :error
 :error {:type :timeout}}
```

`:status` can be any of:

* `:ok` - HTTP 200 response
* `:created` - HTTP 201 response
* `:error` - based on the `:type` key in the `:error` map

`:error` statuses may optionally include an `:error` map with a `:type` key.
In this case, the HTTP response is determined by `:type`

* `:semantic` - HTTP 400 response
* `:validation` - HTTP 400 response
* `:not-found` - HTTP 404 response
* `:server` - HTTP 500 response
* `:timeout` - HTTP 504 response
* without a `:type` - HTTP 500 response
* (more to come)

If you want to add anything else to the `params-map`, then just put an
interceptor in front of your core.async interceptor that adds keys & values to
the `[:request :bifrost-params]` key path in the context.
Bifrost will then merge the `:bifrost-params` value into everything
else so those keys will clobber the others in the final `params-map`.

### Update Interceptors

The `bifrost.interceptors` namespace includes some handy interceptors for
transforming your requests and responses before and after bifrost relays
them over the core.async channels in your routes.

Specifically:

* `update-in-request`
    * 2-arity version takes a key path (like `get-in`) and a function.
    * 3+-arity version takes a source key path, a target key path, a function,
    and any additional args to that function.
    * It returns a before interceptor that gets the value at (source-)key-path
    in the request, calls the function argument on it as the first arg, and then
    assoc's the return value into the request at (target-)key-path.
    * If the target-key-path is different than the source-key-path, the last key
    in source-key-path will be dissoc'd from the request data structure.
* `update-in-response`
    * Just like `update-in-request` but returns an after interceptor that
    operates on the response instead of the request.

Use of these interceptors is optional.

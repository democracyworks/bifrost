A Clojure library for building HTTP API gateways using Pedestal and core.async.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/democracyworks/bifrost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/democracyworks/bifrost)

## Usage

Add the library as a dependency in your project.clj:

```clojure
[democracyworks/bifrost "0.1.4"]
```

Require the core namespace in your pedestal service namespace:

```clojure
(ns my-gateway.service
  (:require [bifrost.core :as bifrost]))
```

Then you can use the `bifrost/interceptor` function to create
core.async-backed interceptors.

```clojure
(defn fibonacci-service [n]
  (clojure.core.async/go
    (clojure.core.async/<! (clojure.core.async/timeout 1000))
    (fib n)))

(def fibonnaci-interceptor (bifrost/interceptor fibonacci-service))
```

Bifrost interceptors have `enter` and `leave` functions.

The `enter` function calls the function you provide. It should
immediately return a core.async channel, called the *response
channel*. The enter function returns the context with the response
channel as a key on `:response-channels`.

The `leave` function attempts to take from the response channel. If
it's already closed (e.g., if you've provided another interceptor in
the chain that deals with its contents) it will forward on the context
without change. If it can take from the response channel, it will
transform the response into a context with a response and merge it
with the incoming context. If it cannot take from the response channel
within the timeout, it will create a 504 response.

Bifrost requests are Pedestal requests with the following changes:

* On GET and DELETE
  * Merges `:bifrost-params` -> `:path-params` -> `:query-params` (so
    `:bifrost-params` clobbers `:path-params` which clobbers
    `:query-params`) and calls the function with the `params-map`.
* On POST, PUT, and PATCH
  * Merges `:bifrost-params` -> `:path-params` -> `:body-params` ->
    `:json-params` -> `:transit-params` -> `:edn-params` ->
    `:form-params` -> `:query-params` and calls the function with the
    `params-map`.

Responses should be EDN maps that look like the following:

```clojure
{:status :ok} ; plus any other keys and values you'd like to add
```

`:status` can be any of:
    * `:ok` - HTTP 200 response
    * `:created` - HTTP 201 response
    * `:error`
    * With `:error`, you can add an optional `:type` key whose value
      can be any of:
      * `:semantic` - HTTP 400 response
      * `:validation` - HTTP 400 response
      * `:not-found` - HTTP 404 response
      * `:server` - HTTP 500 response
      * `:timeout` - HTTP 504 response
      * if `:type` is ommitted - HTTP 500 response
      * (more to come)

If you want to add anything else to the `params-map`, then just put an
interceptor in front of your core.async interceptor that adds keys &
values to the `[:request :bifrost-params]` key path in the context.
Bifrost will then merge the `:bifrost-params` value into everything
else so those keys will clobber the others in the final `params-map`.

The `async-interceptor` function is available if you want more control
over what happens to the messages sent and consumed by the
interceptor.

### Update Interceptors

The `bifrost.interceptors` namespace includes some handy interceptors for
transforming your requests and responses before and after bifrost relays
them over the core.async channels in your routes.

Specifically:

* `update-in-request`
    * 2-arity version takes a key path (like `get-in`) and a function.
    * 3+-arity version takes a source key path, a target key path, a function,
    and any additional args to that function.
    * It returns a before interceptor that gets the value at (source-)key-path
    in the request, calls the function argument on it as the first arg, and then
    assoc's the return value into the request at (target-)key-path.
    * If the target-key-path is different than the source-key-path, the last key
    in source-key-path will be dissoc'd from the request data structure.
* `update-in-response`
    * Just like `update-in-request` but returns an after interceptor that
    operates on the response instead of the request.

Use of these interceptors is optional.
